<h1>Pixel Art in Video Games</h1>

<p class="p">Pixel art is making a comeback, especially in the world of video games.</p>

<p class="bold">Art Style</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Style has always been a huge factor 
to how well a game is perceived by players,
and is usually the very first thing that gains 
interest. The type of style can also convey different emotions 
for the type of game. The tone of the game may also be conveyed 
through the style of the game.</p>

<p class="bold">Color Choice</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Color also plays a huge factor is how a game 
will be perceived. The tone of a game, or multiple levels in a game can 
be captured through the use of color. If a game uses bright colors, 
then the game would be seen as having an uplifting tone. If the game had 
lighter, more blue colors, then the tone would be more relaxing, or dejected.</p>

<p class="bold" align="center">However, Color Changes</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Color often changes with each level of the game to give off a different feeling. The first level
could give off a joyful, more energetic color, but a few levels in, and the 
color might change to give the game a darker or more fantasy like feel to it.</p>
